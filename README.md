# File_permissions_in_Linux
Assessing and updating file permissions using the Linux OS

In this project, I will be checking the permissions on files and directories in the Linux operating
system. I will also be updating the permissions based on instructions received from a faux
organization. Updating and checking permissions should happen regularly at an organization
and helps to keep systems and information secure. This project is four pages and shows print
screens of my ability to execute permission tasks using Linux
